# Find Digits

An integer **d** is a divisor of an integer **n** if the remainder of n รท d = 0.

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same digit should be counted (e.g. for n = 111, 1 is a divisor of 111 each time it occurs so the answer is 3).

## Function Description

Complete the findDigits function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of digits of **d** that are divisors of **d**.

findDigits has the following parameter(s):

- n: an integer to analyze

## Input Format

The first line is an integer, **t** , indicating the number of test cases.

The **t** subsequent lines each contain an integer, **n**.

## Constraints

1 <= t <= 15

0 <= n <10<sup>9</sup>

## Output Format

For every test case, count the number of digits in _n_ that are divisors of _n_. Print each answer on a new line.
